        <h3>Employment Protections</h3>
        <p>
            Employment protections and employee benefits are made up of the laws that govern how businesses can treat their workers.
            Government regulation of companies has changed drastically over the course of American history. From the gilded age, where government
            intervention and protections were all but nonexistent, to the New Deal where FDR had the federal government take charge of the economy,
            to today where some groups are still fighting for equality in the workplace.

            <h1>FLSA</h1>
            <p>
                The Fair Labor Standards Act was signed into law by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1938 as part of the new deal.
                The law provided several key protections for American workers. The regulations were able to be enforced by the federal government since they applied to
                employees of companies which carried out business across state lines, which is out of the jurisdiction of state governments.
                <br><br>
                The main provisions put in place for companies introduced by the FLSA were a federal minimum wage, mandatory "time-and-a-half" overtime
                for employees who work over 40 hours a week, and child labor regulations.
                <br><br>
                The fact that the act passed and was actually enforced by the government made life better for workers across the country as well as signifying
                a new age in the United States where the federal government would take a larger, more active, role in regulating the economy and the workplace.

            <h1>The Wagner Act</h1>
            <p>
                As part of his New Deal President Roosevelt signs the National Labor Relations Act, or Wagner Act, into law.
                The law guaranteed workers the right to unionize. This included not only the right to form unions but the engage in collective negotiations and to strike.
                <br><br>
                The New Deal ushered in an era of hands-on regulations by the Federal Government on business in favor of employees.

            <h1>The Bakeshop Act & Lochner v. New York</h1>
            <p>
                The Bakeshop Act was passed in 1895 and was an early attempt at regulating business practices across the country and instituting fair working conditions.
                The law set the maximum number of hours an employee in a bakeshop could work (10 hours a day/60 hours a week).
                <br><br>
                In 1905 the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiff, Joseph Lochner, in the historic case of Lochner v. New York.
                The court ruled the enforcement of the Bakeshop Act unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. This case set a precedent for
                courts using the 14th Amendments to kill regulatory legislation.

            <h1>The Keating-Owen Act</h1>
            <p>
                The Keating-Owen Child Labor Act was signed into law in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson. It's intent was to stop the gilded age practice of using
                child labor in order to lower payroll costs. The law was quashed in 1918 by the United States Supreme Court as unconstitutional under the
                14th Amendment, continuing the trend started in the case of Lochner v. New York of using the 14th Amendment to kill legislation regulating
                businesses or enacting worker's rights.

            <h1>Worker's Rights Today</h1>
            <p>
                Many strides have been made recently to make the American workplace more fair and equal. The Obama administration worked to protect the LGBT community
                in the workplace by recognizing discrimination of an employee based on gender identity or sexual preference as illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
                <br><br>
                There is still a ways to go when it comes to the modern American workplace and worker's rights. The United States still provides very little
                by way of mandating benefits for new parents. Paid maternity leave is not required at all by law and in some places women aren't even guaranteed unpaid leave after having a child.
